                  <span class="text-wrapper-6">
                    Twenty-four hours before serving, start the détrempe: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
                    dough hook, combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast, and stir to combine. Create a well in the
                    center, and pour in the water and milk. Mix on low speed until a tight, smooth dough comes together
                    around the hook, about 5 minutes. Remove the hook and cover the bowl with a damp towel. Set aside
                    for 10 minutes.
                    <br />

                  </span>
                  <span class="text-wrapper-6">
                    Reattach the dough hook and turn the mixer on medium-low speed. Add the butter pieces all at once
                    and continue to mix, scraping down the bowl and hook once or twice, until the dough has formed a
                    very smooth, stretchy ball that is not the least bit sticky, 8 to 10 minutes.
                    <br />

                  </span>
                  <span class="text-wrapper-6">
                    Form the dough into a ball and place seam-side down on a lightly floured work surface. Using a sharp
                    knife, cut two deep perpendicular slashes in the dough, forming a “+.” (This will help the dough
                    expand into a square shape as it rises, making it easier to roll out later.) Place the dough
                    slashed-side up inside the same mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room
                    temperature until about 1½ times its original size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer the bowl to the
                    refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours and up to 12.

            This recipe is a detailed roadmap to making bakery-quality light, flaky croissants in your own kitchen. With
            a pastry as technical as croissants, some aspects of the process — gauging the butter temperature, learning
            how much pressure to apply to the dough while rolling — become easier with experience. If you stick to this
            script, buttery homemade croissants are squarely within your reach.
