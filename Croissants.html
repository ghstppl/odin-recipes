    <p><h2> Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅔ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>⅔ cup unsalted butter, chilled</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    </h2></p>
    <h2> <em>"Steps"</em> </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h2>Step 1</h2>Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 2</h2>Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Combine warm milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a separate bowl; blend milk mixture, yeast mixture, and oil into flour. Mix well and knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over tripled in volume, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 3</h2>Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled, about another 3 hours.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 4</h2>Deflate dough and chill for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 5</h2>Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 6</h2>Smear butter over top two-thirds, leaving a 1/4-inch margin all around. Fold unbuttered third over middle third, and buttered top third down over that.</li>
        </ol>
